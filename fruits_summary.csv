Fruit,Summary
Apple,"An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp., among them the domestic or orchard apple; Malus domestica) Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia and were introduced to North America by European colonists Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition"
Banana,"A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa In some countries, cooking bananas are called plantains, distinguishing them from dessert bananas The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may have a variety of colors when ripe The fruits grow upward in clusters near the top of the plant Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana"
Cherry,"Common rootstocks include Mazzard, Mahaleb, Colt, and Gisela Series, a dwarfing rootstock that produces trees significantly smaller than others, only 8 to 10 feet (2.5 to 3 meters) tall Irrigation, spraying, labor, and their propensity to damage from rain and hail make cherries relatively expensive The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: See cherry blossom and Prunus for ornamental trees Richard Guthrie described in 1629, the ""fruitful valley adorned with...great variety of fruit trees, chestnuts, pears, apples, cherries, plums and all other fruits."" The cultivated forms are of the species sweet cherry (P (See ""production"" section for more information on chilling requirements) Cherries have a short growing season and can grow in most temperate latitudes"
Date,"The primary carbohydrates are monosaccharides, comprising glucose (23-30%), fructose (19-28%), and non-starch polysaccharides (7-10%) of the fruit's total weight Since the males are of value only as pollinators, they are usually pruned in favor of fruit-producing female plants Traditionally the female flowers are the most available for sale and weigh 300–400 grams (10+1⁄2–14 oz) Most of those are limited to a particular region, and only a few dozen have attained broader commercial importance Another significant insect pest is Ommatissus lybicus, sometimes called the ""dubas bug"", whose sap sucking results in sooty mould formation"
Grape,"An offset to the improved eating quality of seedlessness is the loss of potential health benefits provided by the enriched phytochemical content of grape seeds (see Health claims, below) These categories are based on their intended method of consumption: grapes that are eaten raw (table grapes), or grapes that are used to make wine (wine grapes) Resveratrol, a stilbene compound, is found in widely varying amounts among grape varieties, primarily in their skins and seeds Anthocyanins and other pigment chemicals of the larger family of polyphenols in purple grapes are responsible for the varying shades of purple in red wines They are harvested at peak sugar levels (approximately 24% sugar by weight.) In comparison, commercially produced ""100% grape juice"" made from table grapes are normally around 15% sugar by weight"
Orange,"It is an efficient cleaning agent with a pleasant smell, promoted for being environmentally friendly and therefore, preferable to petrochemicals Taste quality tends to improve later in harvests when there is a higher sugar/acid ratio with less bitterness It is characterized by streaks of different shades on the leaves, and deformed, poorly colored, unsavory fruit It was considered a luxury food grown by wealthy people in private conservatories, called orangeries The Sanskrit word reached European languages through Persian نارنگ (nārang) and its Arabic derivative نارنج (nāranj)"
Peach,"The peach (Prunus persica) is a deciduous tree first domesticated and cultivated in Zhejiang province of Eastern China It bears edible juicy fruits with various characteristics, most called peaches and others (the glossy-skinned, non-fuzzy varieties), nectarines The specific name persica refers to its widespread cultivation in Persia (modern-day Iran), from where it was transplanted to Europe and in the 16th century to the Americas It belongs to the genus Prunus, which includes the cherry, apricot, almond, and plum, in the rose family The peach is classified with the almond in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by the corrugated seed shell (endocarp)"
Pear,"Pliny's Natural History recommended stewing them with honey and noted three dozen varieties Quince rootstocks produce smaller trees, which is often desirable in commercial orchards or domestic gardens Raw pear is 84% water, 15% carbohydrates and contains negligible protein and fat (table) caucasica), widely distributed throughout Europe, and sometimes forming part of the natural vegetation of the forests Enclosed within its cellular flesh is the true fruit: 2–5 'cartilaginous' carpels, known colloquially as the ""core"""
Plum,"In terms of nutrition, raw plums are 87% water, 11% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and less than 1% fat Japanese or Chinese plums are large and juicy with a long shelf life and therefore dominate the fresh fruit market Prunocerasus (New World plums) – leaves in bud folded inwards; flowers 3–5 together; fruit smooth, often wax-bloomed Sect Prunus (Old World plums) – leaves in bud rolled inwards; flowers 1–3 together; fruit smooth, often wax-bloomed Sect Without pruning, the trees can reach 12 metres (39 ft) in height and spread across 10 metres (33 ft)"
Watermelon,"Georgia, Florida, Texas, California and Arizona are the United States' largest watermelon producers, with Florida producing more watermelon than any other state Another objective of plant breeders has been the elimination of the seeds which occur scattered throughout the flesh Young growth is densely woolly with yellowish-brown hairs which disappear as the plant ages Leaves are 60 to 200 millimetres (2+1⁄4 to 7+3⁄4 inches) long and 40 to 150 mm (1+1⁄2 to 6 in) wide Charles Fredrick Andrus, a horticulturist at the USDA Vegetable Breeding Laboratory in Charleston, South Carolina, set out to produce a disease-resistant and wilt-resistant watermelon"
Blueberry,"They are covered in a protective coating of powdery epicuticular wax, colloquially known as the ""bloom"" Some 44,000 hectares (110,000 acres) are farmed, but only half of this acreage is harvested each year due to variations in pruning practices Floral and leaf buds develop intermittently along the stems of the plant, with each floral bud giving rise to 5–6 flowers and the eventual fruit The bushes are not planted or selectively bred, but they are pruned or burned over every two years, and pests are ""managed"" In the Bureau of International Labor Affairs report of 2014 on child labor and forced labor, blueberries were listed among the goods produced in such working conditions in Argentina"
Strawberry,"This resistance includes resistance to anthracnose, powdery mildew, and angular leaf spot There are normally adequate levels of phosphorus and potash when fields have been fertilized for top yields A 1997 study assessed many wound volatiles and found all effective against gray mold (B Homologous proteins are found in birch pollen and apple, suggesting that people may develop cross-reactivity to all three species People began using it for its supposed medicinal properties and botanists began naming the different species"
Mango,"Growers and importers worldwide have embraced the cultivar for its excellent productivity and disease resistance, shelf life, transportability, size, and appealing color The fruit has a single flat, oblong pit that can be fibrous or hairy on the surface and does not separate easily from the pulp In 'Alphonso' mango, the lactones and furanones are synthesized during ripening, whereas terpenes and the other flavorants are present in both the developing (immature) and ripening fruits The flowers are produced in terminal panicles 10–40 cm (4–15+1⁄2 in) long; each flower is small and white with five petals 5–10 millimetres (3⁄16–3⁄8 in) long, with a mild, sweet fragrance Dwarf or semidwarf varieties serve as ornamental plants and can be grown in containers"
Kiwi,"The most common symptoms are unpleasant itching and soreness of the mouth, with wheezing as the most common severe symptom; anaphylaxis may occur. These are generally equipped with a watering system for irrigation and frost protection in the spring To deal with these pollination challenges, some producers blow collected pollen over the female flowers Faster ripening occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, pear, or banana In nature, the species are pollinated by birds and native bumblebees, which visit the flowers for pollen, not nectar"
Papaya,"There, the eggs developed into flies in three stages called instars The modifications were made by University of Hawaii scientists, who made the modified seeds available to farmers without charge This parasitism has led to extensive economic costs for nations in Central America The carotenoids, lutein and beta-carotene, are prominent in the yellow skin, while lycopene is dominant in the red flesh (table) The crawlers insert their mouthparts in the lower surfaces of the leaf when they find it suitable and usually do not move again in this stage"
Pineapple,"These were woven into lustrous lace-like nipis fabrics usually decorated with intricate floral embroidery known as calado and sombrado They were initially used mainly for display at dinner parties, rather than being eaten, and were used again and again until they began to rot In 2016, the government declared that it would be trying to improve the situation, with the help of various other groups They were favored for their light and breezy quality, which was ideal in the hot tropical climate of the islands It has almost no resting period but should be repotted each spring until the container reaches 20 centimeters (8 in)"
Lemon,"Citrus require minimal pruning by trimming overcrowded branches, with the tallest branch cut back to encourage bushy growth Throughout summer, pinching back tips of the most vigorous growth assures more abundant canopy development A machine breaks up the cells and uses a water spray to flush off the oil In meat, the acid partially hydrolyzes tough collagen fibers, tenderizing it Hindu deities are sometimes depicted with lemons in their iconography, representing the attribute of wealth or abundance."
Lime,"To prevent scurvy during the 19th century, British sailors were issued a daily allowance of citrus, such as lemon, and later switched to lime Species of this genus hybridise readily; only recently have genetic studies started to shed light on the structure of the genus A class of organic chemical compounds called furanocoumarins are reported to cause phytophotodermatitis in humans Key lime gives the character flavoring to the American dessert known as Key lime pie Raw limes are 88% water, 10% carbohydrates and less than 1% each of fat and protein (table)"
Raspberry,"They propagate using basal shoots (also known as suckers), extended underground shoots that develop roots and individual plants These crops are hosts for the disease Verticillium wilt, a fungus that can stay in the soil for many years and can infest the raspberry crop Later notable hybrids include the olallieberry, boysenberry, marionberry, and tayberry; all are multi-generational hybrids What distinguishes the raspberry from its blackberry relatives is whether or not the torus (receptacle or stem) ""picks with"" (i.e., stays with) the fruit Botrytis cinerea, or gray mold, is a common fungal infection of raspberries and other soft fruit under wet conditions"
Blackberry,"Caterpillars of the concealer moth Alabonia geoffrella have been found feeding inside dead blackberry shoots Byturus tomentosus (raspberry beetle), Lampronia corticella (raspberry moth) and Anthonomus rubi (strawberry blossom weevil) are also known to infest blackberries Unlike its vinegar fly relatives, which are primarily attracted to rotting or fermented fruit, D The taxonomy of blackberries has historically been confused because of hybridization and apomixis, so that species have often been grouped together and called species aggregates Blackberry shrubs can tolerate poor soils, spreading readily in wasteland, ditches, and roadsides"
