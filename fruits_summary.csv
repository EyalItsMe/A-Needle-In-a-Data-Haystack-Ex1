Fruit,Summary
Apple,"The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider or apple juice production The University of Reading, which is responsible for developing the UK national collection database, provides access to search the national collection National Library of Medicine's Hazardous Substances Data Bank records no cases of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds"
Banana,"It involved the combination of modern transportation networks of steamships and railroads with the development of refrigeration that allowed more time between harvesting and ripening The Bashō planted in his garden by a grateful student became a source of inspiration to his poetry, as well as a symbol of his life and home This system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to cultivated varieties Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955 Ecuador and the Philippines were the leading exporters with 5.4 and 3.3 million tonnes, respectively, and the Dominican Republic was the leading exporter of plantains with 210,350 tonnes"
Cherry,"Common rootstocks include Mazzard, Mahaleb, Colt, and Gisela Series, a dwarfing rootstock that produces trees significantly smaller than others, only 8 to 10 feet (2.5 to 3 meters) tall Irrigation, spraying, labor, and their propensity to damage from rain and hail make cherries relatively expensive The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: See cherry blossom and Prunus for ornamental trees Raw sweet cherries are 82% water, 16% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and negligible in fat (table) Cherry wood is valued for its rich color and straight grain in manufacturing fine furniture, particularly desks, tables and chairs."
Date,"According to some sources it probably originated from the Fertile Crescent region straddling Egypt and Mesopotamia while others state that they are native to the Persian Gulf area Traditionally the female flowers are the most available for sale and weigh 300–400 grams (10+1⁄2–14 oz) The leaflets are 30 centimetres (12 inches) long and 2 cm (1 in) wide Since the males are of value only as pollinators, they are usually pruned in favor of fruit-producing female plants Manual pollination is done by skilled labourers on ladders, or by use of a wind machine"
Grape,"An offset to the improved eating quality of seedlessness is the loss of potential health benefits provided by the enriched phytochemical content of grape seeds (see Health claims, below) These categories are based on their intended method of consumption: grapes that are eaten raw (table grapes), or grapes that are used to make wine (wine grapes) Anthocyanins and other pigment chemicals of the larger family of polyphenols in purple grapes are responsible for the varying shades of purple in red wines Commercially cultivated grapes can usually be classified as either table or wine grapes, based on their intended method of consumption: eaten raw (table grapes) or used to make wine (wine grapes) In muscadine skins, ellagic acid, myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and trans-resveratrol are major phenolics"
Orange,"Taste quality tends to improve later in harvests when there is a higher sugar/acid ratio with less bitterness Smudge pots were developed after a disastrous freeze in southern California in January 1913 destroyed a whole crop It is an efficient cleaning agent with a pleasant smell, promoted for being environmentally friendly and therefore, preferable to petrochemicals Large-scale cultivation started in the 10th century, as evidenced by complex irrigation techniques specifically adapted to support orange orchards Current canopy shaker machines use a series of six-to-seven-foot-long tines to shake the tree canopy at a relatively constant stroke and frequency"
Peach,"Particular emphasis in this study is reserved for the analysis of the genetic diversity in peach germplasm and how it was shaped by human activities such as domestication and breeding These bottlenecks highlighted the substantial reduction of genetic diversity associated with domestication and breeding activities The sequence is composed of 227 million nucleotides arranged in eight pseudomolecules representing the eight peach chromosomes (2n = 16) Spain, Italy, Turkey and Greece, all situated in the Mediterranean region, are prominent producers of peaches Peach-wood slips or carved pits served as amulets to protect a person's life, safety, and health"
Pear,"Pliny's Natural History recommended stewing them with honey and noted three dozen varieties A 2019 review found preliminary evidence for the potential of pear consumption to favorably affect cardiovascular health Quince rootstocks produce smaller trees, which is often desirable in commercial orchards or domestic gardens Raw pear is 84% water, 15% carbohydrates and contains negligible protein and fat (table) The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: The purely decorative cultivar P"
Plum,"Japanese or Chinese plums are large and juicy with a long shelf life and therefore dominate the fresh fruit market In terms of nutrition, raw plums are 87% water, 11% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and less than 1% fat Licorice is generally used to intensify the flavor of these plums and is used to make salty plum drinks and toppings for shaved ice or baobing Pickled plums are another type of preserve available in Asia and international specialty stores Brown rot is not toxic, and some affected areas can be cut out of the fruit, but unless the rot is caught immediately, the fruit will no longer be edible"
Watermelon,"Young growth is densely woolly with yellowish-brown hairs which disappear as the plant ages Ideal conditions are a well-drained sandy loam with a pH between 5.7 and 7.2 Many cultivars are available that produce mature fruit within 100 days of planting Another objective of plant breeders has been the elimination of the seeds which occur scattered throughout the flesh Charles Fredrick Andrus, a horticulturist at the USDA Vegetable Breeding Laboratory in Charleston, South Carolina, set out to produce a disease-resistant and wilt-resistant watermelon"
Blueberry,"In the Bureau of International Labor Affairs report of 2014 on child labor and forced labor, blueberries were listed among the goods produced in such working conditions in Argentina As of 2018[update] it remains relatively unmolested by pests and diseases (see Diseases below) Floral and leaf buds develop intermittently along the stems of the plant, with each floral bud giving rise to 5–6 flowers and the eventual fruit Kaolin clay for Rhagoletis mendax also reduced effectiveness of Diachasma alloeum, its parasitoid Cyanococcus blueberries can be distinguished from the nearly identical-looking bilberries by their flesh color when cut in half"
Strawberry,"A 1997 study assessed many wound volatiles and found all effective against gray mold (B There are normally adequate levels of phosphorus and potash when fields have been fertilized for top yields People began using it for its supposed medicinal properties and botanists began naming the different species This resistance includes resistance to anthracnose, powdery mildew, and angular leaf spot Homologous proteins are found in birch pollen and apple, suggesting that people may develop cross-reactivity to all three species"
Mango,"Growers and importers worldwide have embraced the cultivar for its excellent productivity and disease resistance, shelf life, transportability, size, and appealing color The discovery was made by Filipino horticulturist Ramon Barba in 1974 and was developed from the unique traditional method of inducing mango flowering using smoke in the Philippines Dwarf or semidwarf varieties serve as ornamental plants and can be grown in containers In India, harvest and sale of mangoes is during March–May and this is annually covered by news agencies In this case, the irritant is likely to be the vaporized essential oil from flowers"
Kiwi,"The most common symptoms are unpleasant itching and soreness of the mouth, with wheezing as the most common severe symptom; anaphylaxis may occur. To deal with these pollination challenges, some producers blow collected pollen over the female flowers These are generally equipped with a watering system for irrigation and frost protection in the spring Therefore, most kiwifruits, with the exception of rootstock and new cultivars, are propagated asexually In nature, the species are pollinated by birds and native bumblebees, which visit the flowers for pollen, not nectar"
Papaya,"The flowers are five-parted and highly dimorphic; the male flowers have the stamens fused to the petals The crawlers insert their mouthparts in the lower surfaces of the leaf when they find it suitable and usually do not move again in this stage This parasitism has led to extensive economic costs for nations in Central America The fungus-like oomycete Phytophthora causes damping-off, root rot, stem rot, stem girdling, and fruit rot The first instar has well-developed legs and is the only mobile immature life stage"
Pineapple,"These were woven into lustrous lace-like nipis fabrics usually decorated with intricate floral embroidery known as calado and sombrado They were initially used mainly for display at dinner parties, rather than being eaten, and were used again and again until they began to rot It has almost no resting period but should be repotted each spring until the container reaches 20 centimeters (8 in) In 2016, the government declared that it would be trying to improve the situation, with the help of various other groups Some pests that commonly affect pineapple plants are scales, thrips, mites, mealybugs, ants, and symphylids"
Lemon,"Citrus require minimal pruning by trimming overcrowded branches, with the tallest branch cut back to encourage bushy growth A machine breaks up the cells and uses a water spray to flush off the oil One educational science experiment involves attaching electrodes to a lemon and using it as a battery to produce electricity Throughout summer, pinching back tips of the most vigorous growth assures more abundant canopy development Spanish conquest throughout the New World helped spread lemon seeds"
Lime,"Species of this genus hybridise readily; only recently have genetic studies started to shed light on the structure of the genus A class of organic chemical compounds called furanocoumarins are reported to cause phytophotodermatitis in humans To prevent scurvy during the 19th century, British sailors were issued a daily allowance of citrus, such as lemon, and later switched to lime Key lime gives the character flavoring to the American dessert known as Key lime pie The makrut lime, in particular, was one of the earliest citrus fruits introduced to other parts of the world by humans"
Raspberry,"High tunnel bramble production offers the opportunity to bridge gaps in availability during late fall and late spring Later notable hybrids include the olallieberry, boysenberry, marionberry, and tayberry; all are multi-generational hybrids The voracious feeding habits of Japanese beetles not only pose a direct threat to raspberry plants but also increase the risk of transmitting various plant diseases These crops are hosts for the disease Verticillium wilt, a fungus that can stay in the soil for many years and can infest the raspberry crop Furthermore, high tunnels allow less hardy floricane-fruiting raspberries to overwinter in climates where they would not otherwise survive"
Blackberry,"Caterpillars of the concealer moth Alabonia geoffrella have been found feeding inside dead blackberry shoots These types are less vigorous than the semi-erect types and produce new canes from root initials (therefore they spread underground like raspberries) Since the many species form hybrids easily, there are numerous cultivars with more than one species in their ancestry The taxonomy of blackberries has historically been confused because of hybridization and apomixis, so that species have often been grouped together and called species aggregates Unlike its vinegar fly relatives, which are primarily attracted to rotting or fermented fruit, D"
